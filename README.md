Blog1: What is type inference in TypeScript? Why is it helpful?

In simple words TypeScript guesses the type of your variables when you don‚Äôt tell it explicitly. This is know as Type inference

Example : let name = "Yousuf Mohammad";

even though I havent said anywhere in the code this is a string , but TypeScript will take the variable " name" as string .

whats more interesting is , We can not assign value of any other type but string .

Example : name = 27 ( this will through an error )

Now The most Important question , why is this helpful ? 

1. Less Typing , more chilling : Reduce the stressful typing every single variable . 

We can write : let Chill = 100 // instead of let chill : number = 100 ; 

saves time to watch another episode of my favorite TV series :D

2.Better Auto Completion : Just hover over the variable and see the magic . 

3. Still Fully Typed : The best part is the code is still typed , So I dont have to worry about type safety 

Type Inference in TypeScript is like auto-pilot for types. It keeps you safe, saves time, and lets you focus on the fun parts of coding . 

So Go on , Happy coding
