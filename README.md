Blog1: What is type inference in TypeScript? Why is it helpful?

In simple words TypeScript guesses the type of your variables when you donâ€™t tell it explicitly. This is know as Type inference

Example : let name = "Yousuf Mohammad";

even though I havent said anywhere in the code this is a string , but TypeScript will take the variable " name" as string .

whats more interesting is , We can not assign value of any other type but string .

Example : name = 27 ( this will through an error )
